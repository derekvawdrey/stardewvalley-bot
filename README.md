# Stardew Valley bot for fishing

A proof of concept to attempt to capture a fish on stardew valley using live interaction.

This program does two things:
1. Simulate the fishing minigame to ensure faster training times
2. Implements a DQN to learn how to catch a fish

After a lot of testing, it was determined that this DQN was not efficent at learning how to catch all fish.
